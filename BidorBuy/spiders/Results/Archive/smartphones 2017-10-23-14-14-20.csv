	  ,Ahhhhh - the iPhone 4S. It's a classic isn't it?! This may have been my longest lasting phone, and it was with great sadness that I relegated it to the drawer after holding onto it for as long as I possibly could. They really don't make them like this guy anymore. I hope he finds a good new home!,This particular iPhone 4S is of the ,64GB variety,, which means you can store audio, video, photos and anything else for that matter to your heart's content. My favourite thing about it was that I could carry my whole music library.,The phone still runs smoothly and has been reformatted to factory settings. All you need to do to set it up!,Please note, payment must be made within 48 hours of the auction closing and bids from negative or zero rated users will not be accepted.,With the phone, you will also receive:,The original box (can you believe it?!),An iPhone USB charging cable,A 2-prong USB charging adaptor for a wall socket,A charging dock!!!,A special cable doo-hicky that allows you to hook it up to a TV,A retractable cable that allows you to hook it up to RCA audio inputs (like on a high fidelity receiver),In other words, this phone comes with everything you could possibly want or need!,The phone's condition,The phone's condition is definitely in working order. It did have a smashed back plate at one stage but was faithfully serviced and the back plate was replaced. The front display has some signs of wear & tear and the screen image sometimes looks a little washed out, but there are no broken pixels and it works! Both cameras do function fine, just don't expect miracles, especially in low light.,The battery was replaced (twice in fact) and still functions ok. For light use, it will last till the evening. For heavy use, you may need to charge it during the day.,

Splash and water resistance. And it looks every bit as powerful as i,  ,  ,  , , Limited Stock!,Design,iPhone 7 reaches a new level of innovation and precision. The jet black finish is like nothing we’ve ever made. The enclosure is splash and water resistant. The Home button is completely reengineered. And with a new unibody design that’s seamless to the touch, iPhone 7 feels as amazing as it looks., ,Built to be water resistant.,With its entire enclosure reengineered, iPhone 7 is the very first water resistant iPhone. So now you’re protected like never before against spills, splashes, and even dust., ,An all-new Home button.,The Home button on iPhone 7 is an advanced solid-state button designed to be durable, responsive, and pressure sensitive. Working in tandem with the new Taptic Engine, it gives you precise tactile feedback as you press., , ,Camera,iPhone is the most popular camera in the world. Now we’ve reengineered that beloved camera, adding optical image stabilization, an ƒ/1.8 aperture, and a six-element lens to make it even better for shooting photos and videos in low light. And with advanced new features like wide color capture, your photos and Live Photos will look even more vibrant., ,Now your movies are just like the movies.,Videos shot in darker settings with iPhone 7 will look remarkably better, enhanced by optical image stabilization and the all-new ƒ/1.8 aperture. And the 12MP camera captures high-resolution video up to 4K. So you can shoot epic movies of epic moments, even if they’re happening in low light., ,New 7MP front-facing camera. Love your selfie.,The FaceTime HD camera is not only higher resolution, but it also uses wide color capture. So now you can take sharper and more vibrant selfies.,Display.,Almost everything you experience with your iPhone comes to life on its display. It’s where you look at the photos, messages, news, and countless other things that make up your day. The iPhone 7 display uses the same color space as the digital cinema industry, so what you see will be noticeably more brilliant and vibrant.,With a new wide color gamut, the Retina HD display is able to deliver cinemastandard colors — and the best color management in the smartphone industry. More shades of the color spectrum can be used to create an image, meaning that what you see on the screen is a truer representation of the world. So whether you’re checking out photos of that perfect dress or Live Photos you took in the tropics, the colors will be so accurate, it will look like you’re there., ,3D Touch. Now even handier.,When you use 3D Touch, your iPhone responds with subtle taps. So not only will you see what a press can do — you’ll feel it. The new Retina HD display on iPhone 7 deeply integrates 3D Touch throughout iOS. Now you can interact with Messages, Calendar, Mail, and other apps in a more powerful way., ,Audio.,For the first time, iPhone comes with stereo speakers, delivering two times the audio output of iPhone 6s and increased dynamic range. So whether you’re listening to music, watching videos, or making speakerphone calls, iPhone 7 lets you crank it up., ,IN STOCK AND READY FOR IMMEDIATE SHIPMENT,
